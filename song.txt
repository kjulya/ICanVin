No roots

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I’ll grow old I hope I won’t forget to find them
‘Cause I’ve got memories
And travel like gypsies in the night


I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
‘Cause I’ve got memories
And travel like gypsies in the night

And a thousand times I’ve seen this road,
A thousand times

I’ve got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
I’ve got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
I’ve got no roots uh uh uh uh
I’ve got no roots uh uh uh uh

I’ve got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
